# Password-Generator
A unique password generator

## Description 

This webpage contains a password generator. This aim was to create a password generator which uses user input to generate a password which includes lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters. Throughout this project, I have developed my understanding of for loops, console.log, if statements and the use of return. Moving forward, I would think of how to change my code to ensure that for every password generated, there is at least one lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special character included. 

## Installation

To work on this code copy this SSH key: git@github.com:chelsea32568/Password-Generator.git and paste into your desired folder using Git Bash. Then use git pull to pull the file into your local repository. Make necessary changes and then add changes into the git repository by using git add -A, git commit -m "", git push. 

## Usage
